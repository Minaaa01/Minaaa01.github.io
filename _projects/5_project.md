**Context**

In this project **WE** have Built and used models such as VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2,EfficientNetB0 To Detect multiple common referable fundus diseases in retinal images using deep neural networks, helping to identify cases after surgery that require follow up and Mark non-referable images cases with no need for further referral.Â
